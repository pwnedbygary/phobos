# Phobos — Android Multi-System Emulator (ares fork) — HANDOFF

**Phobos** is an Android N64-first multi-system emulator (package `com.phobos.emulator`, module `:app`, native lib `libphobos_android.so`).
Native core is a heavily customized fork of **ares** (JIT recompilers, parallel-RDP Vulkan renderer, libadrenotools Turnip driver). UI is Jetpack Compose.

## 🚀 CURRENT STATUS (2026-09-01)

**Latest work: Neo Geo CD — RENDERING ROUND COMPLETE (committed `9230e4d60` + `783a6cc27`).**
Full technical record (incl. Aug-28 appendix + 2026-09-01 static round): `docs/implementation-plan.md` →
**Task NGCD-M2** (RESOLVED; "Neo Geo CD consolidated reference" block) + **Task NGCD-M3** (residual). Prior
status below.

**Verified on-device (RP6 `49016109`, SamSho RPG):** BIOS menu, NEO-GEO CD logo, title, character select,
level-select (was a black screen), in-fight HUD (life/POW bars, KO counter) + characters + backgrounds all
correct @59.2 FPS. Game code stays in its main loop.

**Neo Geo CD rendering fixes (2026-08-28, `9230e4d60` — committed & pushed):**
1. **CD sprite DRAM plane order [1,0,3,2]** (MVS cart is [0,2,1,3]) — the CD data bus is word-lane-swapped
   (Geolith `cdmode`; libretro neocd agrees) — `lspc/render.cpp`.
2. **`System::readC` byte lane**: byte@even lives in lane 1 (`.byte(!(address&1))`) — was inverted vs the
   transfer-area upload, scrambling sprite pixels.
3. **CD sprite slots 1..381** (slot 0 unused, 381 IS used; MVS is 0..380).
4. **Tile-number MSB**: CD odd-word bits 4..7 fold into tile bits 12..15 masked to `0x7fff` (Geolith), not
   bits 16..19 like MVS.
5. **THE HUD root cause — DMA `0xe2dd`/`0xfc2d` ("skip odd bytes")**: the port had followed MAME's
   unvalidated LC8953 heuristic (byte zero-extended into separate words = `[b,0,b,0]`, halving the 4bpp
   planes on word-aligned tile data → HUD black boxes / "88888888" glyphs / half-detail characters).
   Rewritten to libretro's mirrored-word layout (`[lo,hi,hi,lo]` per source word) — `dma.cpp`.
6. **OPNB ADPCM** now reads `pcmRam` via `system.readVA` on CD (was `0xff`); PCM upload bank math fixed.
7. **CD read-speed feature REMOVED** (user directive 2026-08-28): `cdd.readSpeed` + all app wiring deleted —
   the drive is fixed at the authentic 75 Hz 1x CDD tick. The feature was unsound: at >1x the BIOS's access
   machine (`$C0E99E`) reads CDC registers the pipeline hasn't written yet → **DISC I/O ERROR ID=0000/0002**
   (observed even at 2x on the final build). The `dumpNgGfx` debug harness remains (`--ez dump_ng_gfx true`).

**Open residual (Task NGCD-M3 — track it):** the **title-menu text glitch** (menu text sprites whose tile
families `0x2000`/`0x0c00`/`0x4376` had a 128-byte lead-in: data at tile*128+0x80, blank at base). Ruled out:
global +0x80 fetch (breaks BIOS menu/characters — block-specific), 0xe2dd source-header skip (breaks
everything — the work-RAM source is already plain tiles). Open hypothesis: dest-bank mismatch at DMA time.
Static CD file-format analysis is the next round (step 2 of the 2026-09-01 plan).

**Neo Geo / Neo Geo CD input default (2026-09-01, `resolveButtonBit`):** Xbox-layout reference,
physical → core button: **X→A, Y→B, A→C, B→D; R1→A+B, R2→C+D, L1→B+C, L2→A+B+C, R3→B+C+D**
(bitmask per core button; Supersedes the Genesis-heritage C→R1/D→R2 single-bit mapping for Neo Geo systems
only). D-pad + Start/Select (coin) unchanged. The full per-core/per-game rebinder is still Tasks 13a-13d.

**Prior status (2026-08-27 — Neo Geo CD M2 boot achieved):**

1. **Raw-sector LBA offset (THE hidden data bug):** `nall::vfs::cdrom` images begin at the disc lead-in —
   logical LBA N lives at physical sector `LeadInSectors + LBAtoABA(N)` = `7500 + N + 150`.
   `Disc::readSectorRaw(lba)` was seeking `lba*2448` → returned ALL-ZERO sectors (blank lead-in), so every
   BIOS content check (`$C0D4C4` directory compare, access machine reads) silently failed. Fixed to
   `2448 * (LeadInSectors + LBAtoABA(lba))` (same mapping as PS1 `drive.cpp`). Raw reads now return real
   disc data (`00ff...` sync pattern, valid directories).
2. **Decoder IRQ vector mix-up (the boot-completion blocker):** the LC8951 decoder-complete event
   (`ctrlChecks`) was sent to vector `$17` (stub `$C0A44E` — unused). It MUST go to vector **`$15`**
   (stub `$C0A40A`, ack `$FF000F=0x20`) which calls the CDD **access machine `$C0E99E`** — the routine that
   advances `$76BC/$7688/$76B6`, letting the boot wait loop `$C0CF56` exit. Wired via `type3Pending`
   (CDDType3=21=0x15). With it, the boot-init completes: BIOS reads the directory, DMA (`ffc5`→`$111204`,
   `fe6d` copies) lands it, and the BIOS **sets `$10F656` bit 7 (disc-ready) itself at `$C0D2E4`**.
3. **IPL gating + ack-based pending (earlier this session):** CDD interrupts are normal level-2 IRQs —
   dispatch only when `2 > r.i`; pending flags cleared by the `$FF000F` ack write, not the dispatch
   (prevents type2 starvation under sector streaming and IRQ-storm wedges).

**VERIFIED ON-DEVICE (final clean build, diagnostics stripped):** boot → CD Player → boot-init (real
directory reads at 75 Hz, DMA, decoder IRQs) → BIOS sets disc-ready itself → Start gate latches
(`$76B9=0x80`) → game code loads → **SamSho RPG title/attract screen renders and animates**, CPU in game
main loop. The `$10F656` bit-0 poke (disc-detected HLE at settle) remains — it triggers the BIOS's own
boot-init, which then does everything else naturally.

**Same-day follow-up (2026-08-27 evening):**
- **"WAIT FOR A MOMENT" 2s blink fixed** — the bit-0 poke is now gated on bit 7 clear
  (`if(!(w.byte(1) & 0x80))`). Every STOP re-armed the settle and every settle re-poked bit 0, so the
  BIOS's boot-init re-ran forever and the menu blipped WAIT every ~2s. Now the disc check runs once.
- **FIX (text) upload-zone heap overrun fixed** — `case 5` mapped `(address>>1) & 0x3FFFF` into a
  128KiB `fixRam`; mask must be `0x1FFFF` (matches libretro neocd). Fixes garbled in-game text.
- **Per-core CD read speed option — REMOVED 2026-08-28 (`9230e4d60`, see CURRENT STATUS above).**
  The drive is fixed at authentic 1x. The old caption: the CDD tick scaled to `75×N` Hz; at >1x the BIOS's
  access machine cannot drain sectors fast enough (MSF=0 / no-response → DISC I/O ERROR ID=0000/0002), so the
  feature was removed at the user's directive. Ring overflow remains guarded in `tick()`.

Open items (non-blocking): flag the unrelated AGP 9.3.1→9.3.2 bump in `android/gradle/libs.versions.toml`;
verify NGCD audio (OPNB/ADPCM path) on-device while in a fight.

**Prior status (2026-08-25)**:

**Latest work:** Task #10c ZX Spectrum 128K FIXED & VERIFIED on-device (commit `1bf97e3ac`). Root cause (proven on-device via temporary ZX128Diag instrumentation, since removed): the 128K core names its system node "ZX Spectrum 128", but `PhobosRunner::pak()`'s tape branch matched `root->name() == "ZX Spectrum"` → empty pak for 128K loads → `Tape::load()` read frequency 0 → cubic resampler ratio 0 → infinite loop in `Cubic::write` on the tape thread's first frame → scheduler wedged, zero frames. Fix: `root->name().beginsWith("ZX Spectrum")`. Verified: Enduro Racer (128K) 50.8 FPS stable (PAL 50Hz), audio ring healthy; Elite 48K regression 50.6 FPS; ZX→SFC reload 60.2 FPS. Prior work same day: Task #10c PCE family FIXED (commit `2795e5813`) — missing PROFILE_PERFORMANCE define compiled out `PSG::main()` → scheduler deadlock on first timer sync; Final Lap Twin 60 FPS, SuperGrafx 60 FPS, Rondo of Blood 60 FPS, SFC/PS1/MD regression 59.9-60.2 FPS.

**Neo Geo — Neo Geo CD (NGCD) M1 VERIFIED ON-DEVICE + COMMITTED (`2c5f7f444`) (2026-08-25):** M1 = BIOS-boot skeleton WORKS — SNK logo renders, CD Player UI boots and displays. Port details: upload zones with banks baked at UPLOAD time (`write()` case 0: `addr&=0xfffff; addr.bit(20,21)=spriteUploadBank`, byte-wise upper/lower; case 5 fix: `(address & 0x3ffff) >> 1`), fetch-side `readC/S/VA/VB` are dead-simple fall-throughs (`spriteRam[addr>>1].byte(addr&1)` / `fixRam[addr]` / `pcmRam[addr]` / `0xff`). KEY GOTCHA: `Model` is BOTH `ares::NeoGeo::Model` (helper struct, `ng.hpp`) and `ares::NeoGeo::System::Model` (enum) — helper calls inside `System::` members MUST be `NeoGeo::Model::NeoGeoCD()`. **M2 (CD drive) CANNOT BE PORTED — the reference branch contains NO CDD/CDC/disc implementation** (verified by fetching the whole tree; it stops exactly at BIOS→CD Player). M2 must be written from scratch; reusable infra exists: PS1 pattern `vfs::cdrom::open(.cue/.chd) → cd.rom` pak file, 2448-byte sectors + `session.decode(subchannel,96)` TOC, libchdr already linked in build. M2 plan: (a) extend `mia/medium/neo-geo-cd.cpp` to attach disc images, (b) CDD command/status processor (research register map — MAME `neocd.cpp` usable as docs only, GPL vs ISC licensing care), (c) CDC DMA into TRANSAREA upload zones, (d) CDDA audio streaming. **AES/MVS REGRESSIONS FROM THE PORT — FIXED:** (1) memory-card read byte order in `cpu/memory.cpp` MUST stay `byte(0)=cardSlot.read(), byte(1)=0xff` (swapping → BIOS "MEMORY CARD ERROR" black screen); (2) `lspc/render.cpp` must NEVER be wholesale-replaced by reference stock code — user's hardware-verified extras (cromMask wrap, MVS rx>=512 hwrap, garou fixBank offsets, vflip/vscale handling) live there; only swap `cartridge.readC/readS`→`system.readC/readS` (×4/×1). Also this day: firmware scanner keyword heuristic (`keywordFirmwareMatch`, commit `656ddd651`) picks up N64DD IPLs under any naming ("64dd"+"ipl" → region keywords).

**Neo Geo CD M2 IN PROGRESS (2026-08-25, uncommitted, CD Player disc detection VERIFIED):** M2a disc plumbing LANDED + COMMITTED (`9511cea73`): `mia/medium/neo-geo-cd.cpp` now attaches `cd.rom` via `vfs::cdrom::open` for `.cue/.chd`; core `Disc` device (`ares/ng/disc/disc.{hpp,cpp}`) decodes TOC via `CD::Session` and serves `readSectorRaw(LBA)` (2448-byte raw). M2b CDD/CDC/DMA research COMPLETE (MAME `neogeocd.cpp` + `megacdcd.cpp` + libretro `neocd`): register map `$FF0002`/`$FF0016`/`$FF0100`/`$FF0102`/`$FF011C`/`$FF0160`-`$FF0164`/`$FF0180`-`$FF0182`/`$FF01A0`-`$FF01A2`/`$FF0060`-`$FF007E`, 10-nibble CDD serial (cmd/status + `+0x5` checksum quirk, StatusHack), LC8951 regs, DMA modes (`cffd`/`e2dd`/`fc2d`/`fe3d`/`fef5`/`ffc5`/`ffcd`), 75Hz sector pipeline. M2b phase-1+2+4 LANDED: `cdd.{hpp,cpp}` (serial `rxRead`/`txWrite`/`commsControl` + all TOC + CDZ `subcmd 7` disc-recognition fix → value `2` for SamSho RPG), `cdc.{hpp,cpp}` (LC8951 regfile `addressWrite`/`dataRead`), `dma.{hpp,cpp}` (LC8359 modes), IRQ wiring (level-2 vectors `0x15`-`0x17`, `FF000E`/`FF000F` ack). **Masks FIXED:** `TRANSAREA`/`SPRBANK`/`PCMBANK`/`Z80RST` were `(addr&0xfffe)==0x01xx` never matching `0xFF01xx` (broken in reference; fixed to `0xfffffe==0xff01xx` — BIOS writes `FF0105`/`FF01A1`). Region `FF011C` defaults to US (English menus). **Verified:** CD Player disc detection WORKS — TOC enumeration completes, disc shows **TRACK 29 / TIME 68:12** (SamSho RPG) and `FF0101`/`FF0103` init writes logged; sector engine streams (`lba 15→43+`, `ctrl=0x0100` data mode, `ctrl0=0xa7`) and disc is recognized. **Remaining blocker:** game boot `START` does nothing — boot state reaches `3` (2426 reads) then stalls waiting for game code at `0x100000` never arriving; `FF0061` DMA never fires (`0` lines), `type1` IRQ (sector completion) starved by constant `type2` (75Hz) — priority `type1>type2` + ack-gating tried, pending at `IPL=7` (3000 `PEND ipl=7` from boot critical section). Next: wire `type1` dispatch without IPL gate and ensure DMA setup (`FF0064`/`FF0070`/`FF0061`) path from `c0ebc0` sector processing reaches `dma.start()`.

**Neo Geo CD (NGCD) M2 — handoff (2026-08-25): input question CLOSED by on-device probe.** A temporary
PAD probe in `ares/ng/controller/arcade-stick/arcade-stick.cpp` (`readControls()`/`pollCoin()`), throttled
`++n % 30 == 1`, logged button state while holding **A** then pressing **Start** on the Retroid built-in pad.

| Evidence (logcat, `NGCD` tag) | Conclusion |
|---|---|
| `PAD probe … a=1` (held A) | A (`k:96`) reaches the core — **input works** |
| `PAD probe … start=1` (pressed Start) | Start (`k:108`) reaches the core — **input works** |
| BIOS programmed CDC (`reg 01←e2`, `0a←a7`, `0b←f0`) + began read (`stat=0001`, ~8 s) | BIOS received Start, started a CD load |
| `t1=0` entire run; `pend=0010` (CDD pending) yet never dispatched | **type1 (sector-completion) IRQ never fires — the boot blocker** |

**Front-end input (`k:` mapping, hotkey capture, `controllerPlayerIndex`) is 100% working — no further input
work.** The blocker is entirely the in-progress NGCD M2 drive/IRQ/DMA pipeline.

**Root cause (static review, cross-ref wiki.neogeodev.org):**
- **Defect 1 — DMA trigger mismatch** (`ares/ng/cpu/memory.cpp:560-575`): LC8953 trigger is the **byte**
  `$FF0061` (`$00`=load microcode, `$40`=start) per the [DMA](https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php/DMA) +
  [LC8953](https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php/LC8953) pages; params 32-bit at `$FF0064`/`$FF0068`/`$FF0070`,
  microcode `$FF0080`-`$FF008E`. Code matches **word** `0xff0060`/`bit6` and swallows microcode → "`FF0061` DMA
  never fires".
- **Defect 2 — CDD/type1 pending but not dispatched** (`ares/ng/cpu/cpu.cpp:38-64`): `pend=0010`, `t1=t2=t3=0`.
  Hypotheses: empty `if(NeoGeo::Model::NeoGeoCD()){}`/early returns skip the CDD block; `type1Pending` cleared
  before dispatch or sector pipeline body not running; `$FF000F` ack swallowed.

> Reference: MAME `neogeocd.cpp` (GPL, docs-only) + proven Sanyo CDC `DTEI`/`DTBSY`/`DTTRG` handshake in
> `ares/md/mcd/cdc.cpp`.

**Repro / next step:** device `49016109` (Retroid Pocket 6, Adreno 740), SamSho RPG disc. Clear logcat, press
Start, `adb -s 49016109 logcat -d | grep -E "NGCD|CDD|CDC|DMA"`. Then wire `type1` dispatch (priority over 75 Hz
`type2`) + the `$FF0061` byte DMA trigger + microcode routing; iterate until the game boots past boot state 3
(code reaches `0x100000`); confirm no AES/MVS regression. See `docs/implementation-plan.md` → **Task NGCD-M2**
and the "Neo Geo CD consolidated reference" block under it.

**Neo Geo (Task #10c, UNCOMMITTED state):** Un-gated for diagnosis via `if (false && identifiedSystem == "Neo Geo")` in PhobosRunner.cpp. kof2003.zip loads (MIA: AES; core reports "Neo Geo MVS", MVS BIOS sp-e.sp1 attached; "VFS: Failed to attach static.rom" = benign warning), **runs 59.2-60.1 FPS sustained** (old black-screen/0-FPS hang GONE). Streams registered: FM (ch=2, 500kHz) + SSG (ch=1, 500kHz). **BUT audio ring stays 0/12000 (0%) and no sound** — multi-stream lockstep (`PhobosRunner.cpp` audio() ~1384-1417: emit only when EVERY stream pending, bounded 8192) or mute path suspect. Video presentation unverified — every adb loader load ran HEADLESS (no navigation → no SurfaceView). FIXES LANDED UNCOMMITTED: (1) debug loader now navigates to the emulator screen (mirrors SystemDetailScreen flow); (2) swap-screen feature (below). After build+deploy: verify NG video via loader, then investigate the 0% audio ring, then finalize gate state + verify MVS/AES + commit.

**Swap-Screen feature (VERIFIED 2026-08-18 on-device, commit pending):** Hotkey to leave a running game to the library/console/settings — emulation PAUSES on leave, UNPAUSES on return; the game is unloaded ONLY via the quit dialog. Implementation: `MainViewModel.navigateTo(route)` SharedFlow navEvents + `emulatorScreenVisible` StateFlow + `swapToLibrary()`/`swapBackToGame()`; `MainScaffold` collects navEvents (special-case library/console/settings with popUpTo(start)+launchSingleTop); EmulatorScreen hotkey `"library"` → swapToLibrary, pause menu gains "Library" button, `onDispose` NO LONGER unloads (kept GameInputState.reset + emulatorScreenVisible=false), quit dialog Quit button calls `unloadSystem()` then onBack; MainActivity debug loader NOW navigates to the emulator screen after loadRom (mirrors SystemDetailScreen load-then-navigate — fixes ALL previous adb loads running headless behind the library); `SettingsStore` defaults mirrored from the developer's device config (Z-button based: 101=Z + A/B/X/Y/L1/R1/L2/R2/DPAD/SELECT/START/C etc.; library = Z+C = [101,98]; ff_hold unbound; analog_toggle = C alone [98]); HotkeyMappingScreen label "Swap to Library". KEY INSIGHT: the content-view OnKeyListener only fires when NO focused view consumes the key — on the library screen Compose absorbs them — so the RETURN hotkey is intercepted at window level via a `Window.Callback` wrapper (ComponentActivity restricts overriding dispatchKeyEvent itself). Swap away+back verified round-trip on-device; quit dialog unload verified. Testing caveat: adb `input keyevent` cannot hold combos — hotkeys must be tested with the real controller.

**All cores verified WORKING** including Neo Geo MVS/AES (input, BIOS dialog, and tall-sprite/background rendering all FIXED and verified).

**Neo Geo — 2026-08-24 VERIFIED (vflip tile-ordering regression REVERTED, commit `pending`):** `e92486f72`'s undocumented "vflip tile ordering" hunk in `ares/ng/lspc/render.cpp` (LLM guess, contradicts MAME `neogeo_spr.cpp` — which does per-tile fetch + `row ^= 0xf` XOR and never reorders tiles) broke tall-sprite rendering (`kof2003` title = half-tiles/misaligned rows). Reverted ONLY that hunk to the exact `b1c0a9fe1` code; the rest of `e92486f72` (SMA P-ROM BE decrypt, Z80 audio banking, coin polling) is intact — **do NOT `git revert e92486f72`** (bundled 24 files). Verified clean on-device `49016109` via `see_image` screencaps: **`kof2003` title (was garbled), `kof98` (PROGSF1) title, `kof99` (SMA) title**; `ssideki4` title/how-to-play/championship screens clean. `ssideki4` **in-match** field garble persists = the SEPARATE pre-existing zoom-path issue (was NOT introduced by this revert). `AudioDiag ring=0/12000` still logs (known separate issue; KOF2003 audio user-confirmed working). **VERIFICATION GOTCHA:** hot ROM reload via `am start --activity-single-top` can leave the SurfaceView showing the PREVIOUS core's stale frame (kof98 load once displayed ssideki4's soccer screen — core loaded fine per logcat); if a post-reload screen looks like the wrong game, `am force-stop` + cold `am start` before judging.

**Neo Geo — 2026-08-23 VERIFIED (all 288 titles boot):** SMA boot **FIXED & VERIFIED** on-device for `kof99`/`kof2000`/`garou`/`garouh`/`mslug3`/`mslug3a` (was `69K` grid, now `414K`/`263K`/`582K`/`415K` titles `@59.2 FPS`). Root cause was **two-fold**: (1) hardcoded `p[0..7]=0x10f300` override, **plus** (2) endianness bug: SMA decrypt used `u16*` little-endian cast while `prom` is `readm(2L)` big-endian and `BML` was `load16_word_swap` — `P` double-swapped → garbage. Fixed `BML` to keep `load16_word_swap` for `ka.neo-sma`/`251-p1` etc. (`262144` for `ka`) and changed decrypt to `readBE`/`writeBE` (`p[off]<<8|p[off+1]`) matching `prom` BE. Verified vectors `0010f300` `NEO-GEO` and `SMA prom` `0010f300`. `kof98` `PROGSF1` also verified, `kof94`/`kof2001` standard titles verified. **REMAINING 2026-08-23:** (1) **Sound** — `samsho`/`samsho2` silent, `AudioDiag ring 0/12000` (log shows `ring 0` for all Neo Geo, but `KOF2003` user-confirmed audio works; suspected log formatting vs real fault — investigating `PhobosRunner` multi-stream lockstep and `OPNB`/`APU`); (2) **Coin** — `SELECT`/`START` coin works sometimes but not always (pollCoin every-frame via `LSPC` broke audio, reverted to poll only on input reads; need reliable `REG_STATUS_A` coin without per-frame `platform->input`); (3) **ssideki4** — field graphics still garbled in gameplay (hscale `zoom_x_tables` already applied, but `ssideki4` uses different zoom path — investigate `render.cpp` tall-sprite/hscale for this title).
All three are UNCOMMITTED. The `kof99`/`kof2000` `NEO-SMA` "Still ✗" line in the 2026-08-21 compat paragraph is now SUPERSEDED by fix #1.

**Neo Geo compat pass (in progress 2026-08-21 — `wiki.neogeodev.org` as primary ref):** on-device results tracked in `docs/neo-geo-compatibility.md`. **MVS warning-screen stall — ROOT CAUSE found & FIXED for 1994-95 stub:** the 1994-95 boot stub (`tst.b $10FD82; beq pass; tst.w $D00100; beq pass` at `$38D6E` etc.) always failed under `ares` because `$10FD82` (WRAM `$10FD82`, zero after BIOS init on real MVS) is non-zero on a cold boot, so it fell into the green/red `WARNING` hang (`move.b d0,$300001; bra.s *` at `$276`/`$29A`/`$4E2`/`$506` via `tst.b $10FD82`). Earlier `coin`/`freeplay` diagnosis was wrong — `kof95` (standard, no decrypt) was hanging at the same `WARNING` via the same `$10FD82` check, not at the BIOS coin wait. **FIX APPLIED** in `mia/medium/neo-geo.cpp:166` — generic `beq→bra` (`67`→`60`) + `13C0 00300001 60F8`→`4E75` (`rts`) patch (covers all titles sharing the 1994-95 stub, standard and `K2K2`).

**RECENT (2026-08-19 → 2026-08-20, COMMITTED & PUSHED in v1.0.0):**
- **Neo Geo Palette Banking Inversion (FIXED):** In `ares/ng/cpu/memory.cpp`, write handling for `$3A000E` (`REG_PALBANK0`) and `$3A001E` (`REG_PALBANK1`) was inverted (`$3A000E` was setting `pramBank = 1` and `$3A001E` setting `pramBank = 0`). Fixed so `$3A000E` selects bank 0 and `$3A001E` selects bank 1, resolving wrong palette banks during gameplay (e.g. blue grass in *The Ultimate 11*).
- **GPU Driver Downloader (QoL, DONE):** `DriverManagerScreen.kt` — download/install/delete + scrollable "Active Driver" selector (System Default + all installed `*.so`, identity-deduped so no `_2` dupes). Manual installs refresh the list via `_driverSuccessEvent`. Red Delete button (`Color(0xFFD32F2F)`). Active driver set via `setCustomDriverPath`.
- **Neo Geo BIOS dialog is now truthful:** only shows "Neo Geo BIOS Required" when `neogeo.zip` is truly absent; otherwise "Neo Geo ROM Failed to Load" (e.g. 1941 is a CPS-1 Capcom title, NOT Neo Geo — it is absent from MIA's Neo Geo DB, so loading it as Neo Geo always fails and the old popup wrongly blamed the BIOS). Native BIOS-attach branch now also matches a bare `"Neo Geo"` nodeName. Memory `bugfix/neogeo-bios-dialog`.
- **Neo Geo INPUT FIX:** the Neo Geo `ControllerPort` connects an "Arcade Stick" (correct — `connectDevices` already routes Neo Geo → `"Arcade Stick"` at `PhobosRunner.cpp:2088`; my `port.cpp` edit accepting `"Gamepad"` is a harmless no-op). The actual dead input was a FRONT-END bug: many controllers report the D-pad as a HAT axis, which `GameInputState.updateHotkeyDpad` only routed into `hotkeyKeys` (hotkey combos), never into gameplay button bits. Fixed by latching the hat D-pad into `hwButtons` bits 0–3 (`GameInputState.kt`). A/B/C/D always worked (they arrive as keycodes); analog sticks are digital-only for Neo Geo (expected, NOT a bug). Memory `bugfix/neo-geo-input-gamepad`.
- **Neo Geo Background Graphical Glitch (FIXED & VERIFIED on-device):** Samurai Shodown (and other games using 32-tile tall background sprites) had a massive black horizontal band across the middle of the screen. Root cause in `ares/ng/lspc/render.cpp`: `tile` was declared as `n4` (4-bit integer, 0..15). For lines `ry >= 256` (lower half of 32-tile sprites), `tile ^= 0x1f` truncated to 4 bits (`tile ^= 0x0f`), wrapping back to tiles 0..15 instead of accessing tiles 16..31 in VRAM. Changed `tile` to `n5` (5-bit integer, 0..31). Also safeguarded `cartridge.cromMask()` tile wrapping. Verified on-device via screencap: center screen black rows dropped from hundreds to 0, background renders continuously.

**Next priority:** Task #49 (N64 save import/export UI), commit current Neo Geo + driver downloader work.

## NEO GEO CD (future task — reference)
ares has a dedicated Neo Geo CD fork branch by Luke Usher: `https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/tree/neogeo-cd`. Closely linked hardware to AES/MVS — once AES/MVS work, pull ONLY the files needed for the NG CD core (CD-ROM hardware + CD audio paths; do NOT pull the whole branch) and port them into `ares/`. Track as a new task after Task #10c lands.

## ALWAYS-READ REFERENCES (for details not covered here)
- **Implementation plan (DEEP reference — task queue + full notes):** `/home/garyb/LLM-Projects/phobos/docs/implementation-plan.md` — also at `.cache/.../implementation_plan.artifact.md` (same content; the in-repo copy is authoritative). Priority queue = open only; ✅ Complete section = archived write-ups; IN FLIGHT = detailed status.
- **README.md** (repo root) — full systems matrix, feature list, build requirements.
- **Prior huge conversation (grep for context):** `/home/garyb/Desktop/agent-mode-conversation.json`.

## Repo Layout & Key Files
- `/home/garyb/LLM-Projects/phobos/android` — Android app Gradle project.
  - `app/src/main/cpp/PhobosRunner.cpp` — Platform bridge: emulation thread, AndroidPlatform (input/video/audio/pak), save import/export, settings sync.
  - `PhobosRunner.hpp`, `PhobosJNI.cpp`, `PhobosCore.kt`, `MainViewModel.kt`, `EmulatorScreen.kt`, `SettingsStore.kt`, `PathSettingsScreen.kt`, `MainActivity.kt`, `TouchControls.kt`, `GameInputState.kt`.
- `/home/garyb/LLM-Projects/phobos/ares` — Native core fork (N64 in `ares/n64/`, parallel-RDP Vulkan in `n64/vulkan/`).
- `/home/garyb/LLM-Projects/phobos/thirdparty/` — parallel-rdp, sljit, adrenotools, volk, etc.

## Build / Deploy / Test
- Build: `gradle app:assembleDebug`. Deploy: IDE deploy module `:app`, `DEFAULT_ACTIVITY`, RUN.
- Device: serial **49016109** (Retroid Pocket 6, Adreno 740, custom Turnip driver at `files/gpu_drivers/libvulkan_freedreno.so`).
- Logcat tags: `Phobos`, `PhobosCore`, `PhobosJNI`, `PhobosVulkan`, `Granite`, `hook_impl`, `vulkan`.

## Verified Major Features & Recent Fixes
1. **N64DD & 64DD Save/RTC Persistence:** Fully working (`fw_n64dd_jp/us`, disk mount, Error 48 RTC seed fix, `program.disk` persistence, base cart reload cleanup).
2. **N64 Rumble Pak & Controller Pak:** Player 1 support, rumble envelope decay per hit (`MainViewModel` / `PhobosRunner`).
3. **GBA RTC (Task 38):** Pokémon Unbound RTC fixed via broadened MIA detection (`RTC_V001`) and pre-connect save import.
4. **PS1 DualShock Analog Toggle (Task 57):** Input cache mutex protection + correct state return for pause menu.
5. **ZX Spectrum 48K:** Fully functional (BIOS, authentic on-screen keyboard, TZX/TAP tape playback, custom rebinds, signed-char fix).
6. **Multi-Stream Audio Mixer (Task 23):** Lockstep mixer supporting multi-stream cores (MD/MCD, ZX, MSX, PCE-CD).
7. **Auto Save-State Slot (Task 17):** Auto-save on quit / auto-load on boot, integrated in pause menu and cycler.
8. **Rogue Squadron & Conker/MT:** Render stability via parallel-RDP scanout race fix and field-toggle correctives.
9. **PS1 CD-DA Audio Pops (Task 46 — 2026-08-18):** Fixed via fade envelope on playback state transitions. Root cause: disc drive state changes (reading/playingCDDA) would snap samples from music→0, creating hard clicks. Solution: 150-sample linear fade (3.4ms @ 44.1kHz) applied in `cdda.cpp:clockSample()` when entering/exiting CD-DA playback. Eliminates pops without audio artifacts. Commit `1822c5757`.
10. **Ape Escape cinematics (Task 9 — 2026-08-18):** Fixed XA filter routing. Ape Escape's `TITLE.STR` interleaves `subMode=0x48` channel-0 MDEC video/data sectors with `subMode=0x64` channel-1 XA audio sectors. Phobos applied the configured file/channel filter to both, dropping the video sectors before the CD FIFO. Filtering now applies only to XA audio sectors (`subMode & 0x44`), allowing video data to reach MDEC. Verified on Retroid Pocket 6 with a clean build and cold USA-region launch; intro plays and reaches the menu normally.

## Open Priority Queue
- **Neo Geo MVS/AES — CORE FULLY WORKING (games load/run ~60 FPS, audio, input, and tall-sprite/background rendering all verified on-device). REMAINING: broad game-compat pass via `docs/neo-geo-compatibility.md`. PCEngineCD deferred until NG fully stable.
- **PER-CORE + PER-GAME CONTROLLER REMAPPING — NEXT PRIORITY (right after NG stable):** Tasks **13a** (per-core custom controller layouts), **13b** (per-core rebinding), **13c** (multi-controller / per-player pad assignment), **13d** (per-game rebinding). All four done together (same code path). 3-tier hierarchy like RetroArch — **Global** default → **Per-Core** override → **Per-Game** override (top priority wins). Pulled up from the QoL phase: Neo Geo C/D currently land on R1/R2 (Genesis-heritage bit mapping in `resolveButtonBit`); per-core defaults + user rebinding (and per-game overrides for weird default control schemes) is the proper fix.
- **#72:** N64 RDP-ParaLLEl perf investigation vs pwnedbygary/mupen64plus-ae-turnip (some games far faster there — port applicable fast paths).
- **#49:** N64 save import/export UI (.sra/.eep/.fla/.mpk).
- **#52:** PS1 multi-disc swap verify (MGS disc 2 swap fix applied via recursive `scan`).
- **#61:** Proper release APK signing (FIXED & VERIFIED — stable release keystore in `android/keystore/release.keystore`, distinct from debug keystore, supports in-place upgrades across releases).
- **Other:** Task 42 (Perf Monitor settings), Task 51 (ZX multi-tape swap).

## Working Agreements & Policies

- **Measure first, then fix** — never blind-patch the recompiler.
- **Accuracy vs. Speed** — accuracy is preferred, but never below full 60 FPS (raise `JitInterleaving` / perf knobs if below floor).
- **Commit + push on every good result** — checkpoint working states immediately (`git add -u`, descriptive commit, push).
- **Auto-deploy after every build** — immediately deploy to device after `assembleDebug`.
- **UI Toggles** — use `rememberUpdatedState` for state params inside `pointerInput` gesture handlers.
- **Vulkan Mutex** — the abandon path must NEVER take `vulkan.mutex` (zombie deadlock).
- **Documentation** — update BOTH handoff.md AND implementation-plan.md on every completed task before moving to next one.

## Practical Build & Debug Tips

**Gradle Performance (if VS Code CPU spiking to 100%):**
- Add to `android/gradle.properties`:
  ```properties
  org.gradle.workers.max=2
  org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1024m
  android.enableBuildCache=true
  ```
- Only compile one variant: `./gradlew app:assembleModernDebug` (not full `assembleDebug`)
- GPU acceleration: Not practical for Gradle/C++ compilation (CPU-bound)

**ADB from VS Code terminal:**
- Device: `adb devices` — should show **49016109** (Retroid Pocket 6)
- Install: `adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/modern/debug/app-modern-debug.apk`
- Launch: `adb shell am start -n com.phobos.emulator/.MainActivity`
- Logcat: `timeout 60 adb logcat | grep Phobos` (or use `-c` to clear first)
- **Debug ROM loader (no UI automation needed):** MainActivity reads intent extras
  `load_uri` / `load_name` / `load_system` (file:// URIs work; quote the whole `am start`
  command so the device shell sees the double quotes — filenames contain parens).
  ALWAYS add `--activity-single-top` for repeat loads (plain `am start` on the running
  instance silently drops onNewIntent on this device). Example:
  ```
  adb shell 'am start --activity-single-top -n com.phobos.emulator/.MainActivity --es load_uri "file:///storage/EBFF-F6C0/ROMs/tg16/Final Lap Twin (USA).zip" --es load_name "Final Lap Twin (USA).zip" --es load_system "PC Engine"'
  ```

**Crash debugging:**
- Quick check: `adb logcat | grep -E "SIGSEGV|crash|FATAL"`
- Full trace: `debuggerd -b <PID>` (watchdog auto-dumps on PhobosRunner hang, ~6s timeout)
- Verify: audio ring buffer health in logcat: `AudioDiag: ring=XXXX/12000 (XX%) xruns+0`

# PSP core

**Status (2026-10-03):** started, at the user's request. Part 1, the Allegrex CPU's interpreter (integer and FPU
instructions) with host tests, is on branch `cursor/psp-core-2b67`; part 2, the recompiler, on
`cursor/psp-recompiler-2b67` on top of it; part 3, the VFPU, on `cursor/psp-vfpu-ares-2b67` on top of that; part 4,
compiled loads and stores straight to RAM, on `cursor/psp-fastmem-2b67`. The user asked for the whole feature to be
stacked and merged at once. Nothing is in the app yet.

## Decisions (the user's, 2026-10-03)

- **An original core, written for Phobos.** PPSSPP's code can't come in: it is GPL-2.0-or-later, and the firmware
  ares compiles into the native library can't be under the GPL (see LICENSE and the plan's row "Licenses of bundled
  resources"). A translation or rewording of its code would still be its code.
- **PPSSPP as a reference.** When the documentation runs out, or a design question gets stuck, PPSSPP's code and
  its test programs (pspautotests) may be read for how the PSP behaves or how a problem can be approached. The code
  here is written independently; nothing is copied, translated or reworded from PPSSPP or JPCSP.
- **Retail executables are decrypted with the published keys**, as PPSSPP does. The user accepted the risk: in the
  US the DMCA's anti-circumvention rule covers breaking encryption separately from copyright, and Nintendo's suit
  against Yuzu relied partly on it; Sony hasn't acted against PPSSPP in over a decade. The keys are facts; the
  scheme (the KIRK engine, the `~PSP` header) is written from the PSP Developer Wiki's description.
- **High-level emulation (HLE) of the operating system.** The game's code runs on the emulated Allegrex and its
  display lists on the emulated GE, but the PSP's operating system isn't run: the functions games import are
  Phobos's own. No firmware is needed. Booting Sony's kernel (low-level emulation) would need emulating chips that
  are largely undocumented (the Media Engine, the crypto engines, NAND, the system controller, whose firmware isn't
  in a firmware dump), and no PSP emulator has made that work, while HLE reaches nearly the whole library.
- **Firmware as an option, per module family**, as Flycast offers HLE or the real BIOS: the HLE kernel always runs,
  and a setting can load Sony's own library modules from the user's firmware where running them is easier than
  reimplementing them (the system fonts in `flash0:/font`, the audio codec libraries, perhaps video playback).
  The decryption keys can't come from there: they are in the PSP's crypto hardware, not in the firmware files.
- **A recompiler from the start, the interpreter as its fallback.** Speed and accuracy are the project's aims, so
  the CPU gets a dynamic recompiler (dynarec) early rather than as a late optimization. The interpreter stays: it is
  the reference the recompiler is tested against, and runs whatever the recompiler doesn't handle. The recompiler's
  MIPS-generic parts are kept apart so other MIPS systems can reuse them (ares's PS1 CPU is interpreter-only).
- **Code in the style of ares and near**, so it reads as part of the same codebase: plain structs with public
  members, `auto f() -> T`, one function per instruction named after its mnemonic, decoder tables built with
  macros as in ares's PS1 and N64 cores. Everything important is explained in plain language in the comments, for
  someone who has never seen a MIPS CPU.

## Sources

- **MIPS32 Architecture for Programmers, Volume II** (MIPS Technologies): the base instruction set. The Allegrex is
  a MIPS II core with a single-precision FPU and some MIPS32r2 instructions.
- **pspdev's PSP VFPU documentation** (<https://pspdev.github.io/vfpu-docs/>): the Allegrex's own instructions, and
  the VFPU, with tests behind its statements.
- **binutils' Allegrex support** (David Guillen Fandos, 2023, `gas/testsuite/gas/mips/allegrex.d`): encodings, and
  assembled examples that the CPU tests use as vectors.
- **Yet Another PlayStation Portable Documentation** (yapspd, hitmen): memory map, coprocessor registers, `halt`,
  `mfic` and `mtic`.
- **PSP Developer Wiki** (<https://www.psdevwiki.com/psp/>): the Allegrex, hardware registers, the PRX format and
  KIRK.
- **PSPSDK** (BSD-licensed headers): the operating system's functions, structures and NIDs.
- **PPSSPP and pspautotests**, for behavior the above don't cover; each use is recorded where the code depends on
  it.

## Design

- Under `ares/psp/` (namespace `ares::PlayStationPortable`), as ares's systems are: around the CPU and the other
  parts goes an ares system, which the runner presents the way it presents the others (picture, sound, controls,
  states). The CPU uses only nall and ares's integer types, so it's tested on the host without the rest of ares
  (`tests/allegrex/`, whose `prelude.hpp` stands in for `ares.hpp`).
- The CPU reads and writes memory through virtual `read()` and `write()`, as ares's ARM7TDMI does for the Game Boy
  Advance; the PSP's memory map (scratchpad, VRAM, main RAM, hardware registers) implements them.
- Imports: the loader writes each imported function's stub as `jr ra` with `syscall n` in its delay slot, `n`
  standing for the function's NID. The CPU passes the code to `syscallHook`; by then `pc` already holds the return
  address, so the HLE kernel can return a value in `v0` or switch threads by saving and restoring the CPU's state.
- Graphics: the GE runs the game's display lists into the emulated VRAM with a software renderer first; the GPU
  later.

## The recompiler

Part 2 (`ares/psp/cpu/recompiler.cpp`, `recompiler-ipu.cpp`), built on ares's recompiler framework
(`nall::recompiler::generic`, over sljit, for ARM64 and x86-64) as ares's N64 CPU is:

- **Blocks.** From an address, instructions are compiled up to a branch and its delay slot, the end of the 4 KiB
  section, or an instruction after which compiled code mustn't go on by itself (`syscall`, whose HLE handler may
  switch threads; `break`, `eret`, `halt`). The code works on the interpreter's own registers, so either engine
  can carry on where the other stopped, and leaves `pc` and `pd` exactly as the interpreter would.
- **Native and interpreted.** The common integer instructions that can't raise exceptions, and the branches and
  jumps, become native code. Every other instruction is compiled as a call to `execute()`, the interpreter's own
  path, so it behaves identically; that includes everything that can raise an exception, after which the block
  leaves (`pipeline.exception`). The FPU's branches go to the interpreter too, as does a branch in a section's last
  word (whose delay slot is in the next section).
- **Where blocks can't start**, between a branch and its delay slot (a thread the HLE kernel switched to may have
  stopped there) or at a misaligned address, the interpreter takes one step.
- **The cache** files blocks by the section they start in, by physical address (the low 29 bits), and remembers
  which mirror they were compiled for: code run through another mirror is compiled afresh, as its return
  addresses differ. When the code memory (32 MiB) runs low, everything is thrown away and compiled again.
- **Invalidation.** Whoever writes memory that can hold code calls `recompiler.invalidate()` (or
  `invalidateRange()`), which drops the whole section: the PSP's memory map will for every write, the CPU's and
  the ones it doesn't make (DMA, the HLE kernel loading a module); the tests' machine does it for every write.
- **Loads and stores straight to RAM** (part 4, `recompiler-memory.cpp`). The CPU's owner gives it a page table
  (`Allegrex::pages`): for each 4 KiB physical page, where it is in host memory, or nothing for memory read()
  and write() must handle (hardware registers). Compiled `lb`, `lbu`, `lh`, `lhu`, `lw`, `sb`, `sh`, `sw`,
  `lwc1`, `swc1`, `lv.s`, `sv.s`, `lv.q` and `sv.q` check the alignment, look up the page and access host memory
  directly; anything else (a misaligned address, a page without an entry) runs the instruction through the
  interpreter. Stores use a copy of the table without the pages that hold compiled code (`writePages`), so a
  store there goes through write(), which drops that code, and then the page is fast again. `lwl`, `lwr`,
  `swl`, `swr`, `ll`, `sc` and the VFPU's unaligned quads still go to the interpreter.
- **The MIPS-generic parts** (the cache by physical address, delay slots, the calls into the interpreter) are
  plain MIPS and would serve another MIPS CPU without a TLB, such as the PS1's R3000A; only the native
  instructions are Allegrex's.

Not yet: linking blocks to each other (each block returns to the dispatcher), keeping MIPS registers in host
registers, native FPU and VFPU arithmetic, tracking code finer than 4 KiB (a game that writes data next to its
code recompiles that code each time), and code that rewrites itself further on in the block it's running (the
rest of that block runs as compiled; the next run gets the new code).

Speed (`SANITIZE= ALLEGREX_BENCHMARK=1 tests/allegrex/run-tests.sh`, a loop of loads, stores and arithmetic, the
test build at -O1), in millions of instructions a second: on the Mac (ARM64), the interpreter 150, the recompiler
without a page table 505, with it 1206; in the Linux container (ARM64, 4 cores), 135, 219 and 1212. The PSP's CPU
runs at up to 333 MHz.

Tests: every test group runs on both engines, plus recompiler cases (blocks kept in the cache, code that rewrites
a function it already ran, a branch across a section, a thread switch at a syscall in a delay slot to a thread
stopped in another delay slot, a function called through two mirrors, an exception mid-block) and 500 generated
programs (forward branches of every kind, loads and stores, FPU instructions, overflows and misaligned accesses)
that must end in exactly the same state on both: every register, `pc`, `pd`, the FPU, the memory and the
exceptions. Four deliberately broken versions of the recompiler (a wrong compare, a wrong address after a
branch not taken, `nor` without the not, delay-slot instructions given the wrong `pc`) each failed them.

## Phases

1. The Allegrex's integer and FPU instructions in the interpreter, host tests (part 1).
2. The recompiler, with differential tests against the interpreter (part 2; its later steps are listed above).
3. The VFPU: registers, prefixes, instructions, tested against the pspdev documentation's descriptions (part 3).
4. Memory map; loading an unencrypted `EBOOT.PBP`, ELF or PRX; the first HLE functions (module start, threads,
   display, controls, files); a homebrew test program run on the host.
5. The GE: display lists, a software rasterizer (2D first), the display.
6. In Phobos: the system's entry, ISO and CSO images, a PSP touch layout, saves in a memory stick folder, states.
7. Retail executables: `~PSP` decryption.
8. Audio (`sceAudio`, then ATRAC3+ and MP3), video (PSMF), the optional firmware modules.

## Part 1: the Allegrex CPU

`ares/psp/cpu/`: `allegrex.hpp` (the registers and every instruction's declaration), `allegrex.cpp` (fetch and
run), `interpreter.cpp` (the decoder tables), `interpreter-ipu.cpp`, `interpreter-fpu.cpp`, `interpreter-scc.cpp`
(the instructions) and `exceptions.cpp`. An interpreter with branch delay slots (a taken branch sets the address
after the delay slot), likely branches that skip their delay slot when not taken, the Allegrex's encodings for
`clz`, `clo`, `madd`, `maddu`, `msub` and `msubu`, its `min`, `max`, `bitrev`, `wsbw`, `halt`, `mfic` and `mtic`,
unaligned loads and stores (`lwl`, `lwr`, `swl`, `swr`, little-endian), `ll` and `sc`, and the FPU: arithmetic,
compares and their branches, and conversions with the four rounding modes. FPU registers hold bit patterns, so moves
keep NaN payloads. Exceptions go to `exceptionHook` (HLE has no exception vectors), and VFPU instructions raise
ReservedInstruction until part 2.

Not checked against hardware: the result of dividing by zero (it gives what MIPS cores commonly do: `lo` = −1 or 1
by the dividend's sign, `hi` = the dividend), FPU arithmetic in rounding modes other than nearest (the host's
nearest is used), and conversions of NaN or out-of-range values (0x7fffffff, MIPS's default).

Tests: `tests/allegrex/run-tests.sh` (14 groups, with the undefined-behavior sanitizer; on Linux the address
sanitizer too, which the PSP Core Tests workflow runs for changes to `ares/psp/`, nall or ares's types).
`harness.hpp` holds the test machine (a CPU over 64 KiB of RAM) and the instruction encoders.

## Part 3: the VFPU

`ares/psp/cpu/interpreter-vfpu.cpp`, with its decoder tables in `interpreter.cpp`: all of the VFPU's instructions,
one function each, named after their mnemonics. The register file is eight 4x4 matrices of floats; a 7-bit
register number names a single, a row or column vector (pair, triple, quad) or a matrix, by the operand size
(`vfpuLine()`, `vfpuSquare()`). Source prefixes swizzle, take absolute values, negate or substitute constants;
the destination prefix saturates or masks; every VFPU instruction but the prefix ones uses them up. Denormals
count as zero both ways, and only round-to-nearest exists. The recompiler runs the VFPU through the interpreter
for now (its branches included), as it does the FPU.

The random number generator is the hardware's, as fp64 worked it out from a PSP's output (PPSSPP issue 16946):
a linear congruential generator, a xorshift and a Pell-like sequence with a carry, added together, their state
packed into the eight RCX registers (`vfpuRandom()`); `vrnds` spreads its seed over them; `vrndi` and `vrndf`
fill lanes from the last back, and their destination prefix only reaches the last lane. Implemented from that
description (no PPSSPP code), and checked against the user's PSP: its state at power on and the numbers of 64
seeds all match, including those that exercise the carry (psp-vfpu-measurements.md).

The math functions `vrcp`, `vnrcp`, `vrsq`, `vsqrt`, `vexp2`, `vrexp2`, `vsin`, `vcos`, `vnsin` and `vasin` (and
`vrot`'s sine and cosine) are the PSP's own: its quadratic interpolator with coefficients fitted from our
measurements (`vfpu-segments.hpp`, from `tools/psp-vfpu-measure/fit.py`), exact on every measured input; see
psp-vfpu-measurements.md. So is `vlog2` below 4, from a fixed-point table and a cheaper straight-line path below 1;
from 4 up about half its results are one unit above the PSP's, which drops more precision there.

Not checked against hardware: `vrot` on its own (it uses vsin's and vcos's), `vwbn` (implemented from its
description; no test), and what reserved size combinations do (they raise ReservedInstruction, and leave the
prefixes). Which instructions use up the prefixes: every VFPU
arithmetic instruction, and `vnop`, as pspdev's documentation says (PPSSPP keeps them through `vnop`, but the
documentation rests on tests on hardware); not `vsync`, `vflush`, `vmfvc` and `vmtvc`, which the documentation
doesn't cover, as in PPSSPP; nor the loads, stores and moves to integer registers.

Tests: `tests/allegrex/vfpu.cpp`, ten groups (addressing, arithmetic, prefixes, products, comparisons,
conversions, functions, matrices, moves, and more instructions worked out by hand from the descriptions), run on
both engines; the generated programs that compare the engines include VFPU instructions and its branches, and
compare its registers, prefixes and condition codes.

### Measuring the VFPU on a PSP

To make the math functions exact from our own data (the user chose this over adopting PPSSPP's GPL tables, and
has a PSP to run it on), `tools/psp-vfpu-measure` records what a real PSP computes. It's a homebrew program, built
with pspdev's toolchain (`make` in that folder, with `psp-config` on the PATH; the `phobos-linux` container has the
toolchain in `/opt/pspdev`). On a PSP with custom firmware it writes, beside its EBOOT.PBP in `results/` (about
450 MB, resumable):

- every input of the range each math function reduces its argument to (`vrcp` over [1, 2), `vrsq` and `vsqrt` over
  [1, 4), `vexp2` and `vrexp2` over [1, 2), `vlog2` over [1/2, 2), `vsin`, `vcos` and `vasin` over k / 2^23), and a
  million spread-out inputs for each of them and their negated forms;
- the random number generator: its state and numbers at start, then the state after `vrnds` and 4096 draws for 64
  seeds (some chosen to exercise the carry), and `vrndi.q`'s lane order;
- `vadd`, `vsub`, `vmul`, `vdiv` and `vdot` on spread-out inputs (every sign, size, denormal, infinity and NaN).

`manifest.txt` says how each file's inputs are made; the files hold only the hardware's results. The user ran it
on 2026-10-03 (firmware 6.61): [psp-vfpu-measurements.md](psp-vfpu-measurements.md) has the results and findings.
The random number generator matched every word; `vadd`, `vsub`, `vmul` and `vdiv` matched every non-NaN result,
and match NaNs too now that the core gives the VFPU's own NaN (`NaNSign`); the math functions and `vdot` are next.
`tests/allegrex/measured/` keeps the generator and arithmetic files, which the tests check the core against.

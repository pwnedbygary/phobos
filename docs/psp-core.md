# PSP core

**Status (2026-10-03):** started, at the user's request. Part 1, the Allegrex CPU's interpreter (integer and FPU
instructions) with host tests, is on branch `cursor/psp-core-2b67`; the recompiler comes next. Nothing is in the app
yet.

## Decisions (the user's, 2026-10-03)

- **An original core, written for Phobos.** PPSSPP's code can't come in: it is GPL-2.0-or-later, and the firmware
  ares compiles into the native library can't be under the GPL (see LICENSE and the plan's row "Licenses of bundled
  resources"). A translation or rewording of its code would still be its code.
- **PPSSPP as a reference.** When the documentation runs out, or a design question gets stuck, PPSSPP's code and
  its test programs (pspautotests) may be read for how the PSP behaves or how a problem can be approached. The code
  here is written independently; nothing is copied, translated or reworded from PPSSPP or JPCSP.
- **Retail executables are decrypted with the published keys**, as PPSSPP does. The user accepted the risk: in the
  US the DMCA's anti-circumvention rule covers breaking encryption separately from copyright, and Nintendo's suit
  against Yuzu relied partly on it; Sony hasn't acted against PPSSPP in over a decade. The keys are facts; the
  scheme (the KIRK engine, the `~PSP` header) is written from the PSP Developer Wiki's description.
- **High-level emulation (HLE) of the operating system.** The game's code runs on the emulated Allegrex and its
  display lists on the emulated GE, but the PSP's operating system isn't run: the functions games import are
  Phobos's own. No firmware is needed. Booting Sony's kernel (low-level emulation) would need emulating chips that
  are largely undocumented (the Media Engine, the crypto engines, NAND, the system controller, whose firmware isn't
  in a firmware dump), and no PSP emulator has made that work, while HLE reaches nearly the whole library.
- **Firmware as an option, per module family**, as Flycast offers HLE or the real BIOS: the HLE kernel always runs,
  and a setting can load Sony's own library modules from the user's firmware where running them is easier than
  reimplementing them (the system fonts in `flash0:/font`, the audio codec libraries, perhaps video playback).
  The decryption keys can't come from there: they are in the PSP's crypto hardware, not in the firmware files.
- **A recompiler from the start, the interpreter as its fallback.** Speed and accuracy are the project's aims, so
  the CPU gets a dynamic recompiler (dynarec) early rather than as a late optimization. The interpreter stays: it is
  the reference the recompiler is tested against, and runs whatever the recompiler doesn't handle. The recompiler's
  MIPS-generic parts are kept apart so other MIPS systems can reuse them (ares's PS1 CPU is interpreter-only).
- **Code in the style of ares and near**, so it reads as part of the same codebase: plain structs with public
  members, `auto f() -> T`, one function per instruction named after its mnemonic, decoder tables built with
  macros as in ares's PS1 and N64 cores. Everything important is explained in plain language in the comments, for
  someone who has never seen a MIPS CPU.

## Sources

- **MIPS32 Architecture for Programmers, Volume II** (MIPS Technologies): the base instruction set. The Allegrex is
  a MIPS II core with a single-precision FPU and some MIPS32r2 instructions.
- **pspdev's PSP VFPU documentation** (<https://pspdev.github.io/vfpu-docs/>): the Allegrex's own instructions, and
  the VFPU, with tests behind its statements.
- **binutils' Allegrex support** (David Guillen Fandos, 2023, `gas/testsuite/gas/mips/allegrex.d`): encodings, and
  assembled examples that the CPU tests use as vectors.
- **Yet Another PlayStation Portable Documentation** (yapspd, hitmen): memory map, coprocessor registers, `halt`,
  `mfic` and `mtic`.
- **PSP Developer Wiki** (<https://www.psdevwiki.com/psp/>): the Allegrex, hardware registers, the PRX format and
  KIRK.
- **PSPSDK** (BSD-licensed headers): the operating system's functions, structures and NIDs.
- **PPSSPP and pspautotests**, for behavior the above don't cover; each use is recorded where the code depends on
  it.

## Design

- Under `ares/psp/` (namespace `ares::PlayStationPortable`), as ares's systems are: around the CPU and the other
  parts goes an ares system, which the runner presents the way it presents the others (picture, sound, controls,
  states). The CPU uses only nall and ares's integer types, so it's tested on the host without the rest of ares
  (`tests/allegrex/`, whose `prelude.hpp` stands in for `ares.hpp`).
- The CPU reads and writes memory through virtual `read()` and `write()`, as ares's ARM7TDMI does for the Game Boy
  Advance; the PSP's memory map (scratchpad, VRAM, main RAM, hardware registers) implements them.
- Imports: the loader writes each imported function's stub as `jr ra` with `syscall n` in its delay slot, `n`
  standing for the function's NID. The CPU passes the code to `syscallHook`; by then `pc` already holds the return
  address, so the HLE kernel can return a value in `v0` or switch threads by saving and restoring the CPU's state.
- Graphics: the GE runs the game's display lists into the emulated VRAM with a software renderer first; the GPU
  later.

## The recompiler (planned)

Built on ares's recompiler framework (`nall::recompiler::generic`, over sljit, for ARM64 and x86-64), the way ares's
N64 CPU uses it (`ares/n64/cpu/recompiler.cpp`):

- Blocks: starting at an address, instructions are compiled until a branch and its delay slot, into native code
  that updates the same registers the interpreter uses. Compiled blocks are kept per 4 KiB of memory.
- Common integer instructions become native code; anything else (rare instructions, the FPU and VFPU at first) is
  compiled as a call to the interpreter's function for it, so every instruction works from the start and gets
  faster one at a time.
- Syscalls and exceptions leave the block, so the HLE kernel sees exactly the state the interpreter would give it.
- A store into memory holding compiled code, or a `cache` instruction over it, throws those blocks away.
- Differential tests: every test program runs through both engines, and the registers and memory must match.

## Phases

1. The Allegrex's integer and FPU instructions in the interpreter, host tests (part 1).
2. The recompiler, with differential tests against the interpreter.
3. The VFPU: registers, prefixes, instructions, tested against the pspdev documentation's examples.
4. Memory map; loading an unencrypted `EBOOT.PBP`, ELF or PRX; the first HLE functions (module start, threads,
   display, controls, files); a homebrew test program run on the host.
5. The GE: display lists, a software rasterizer (2D first), the display.
6. In Phobos: the system's entry, ISO and CSO images, a PSP touch layout, saves in a memory stick folder, states.
7. Retail executables: `~PSP` decryption.
8. Audio (`sceAudio`, then ATRAC3+ and MP3), video (PSMF), the optional firmware modules.

## Part 1: the Allegrex CPU

`ares/psp/cpu/`: `allegrex.hpp` (the registers and every instruction's declaration), `allegrex.cpp` (fetch and
run), `interpreter.cpp` (the decoder tables), `interpreter-ipu.cpp`, `interpreter-fpu.cpp`, `interpreter-scc.cpp`
(the instructions) and `exceptions.cpp`. An interpreter with branch delay slots (a taken branch sets the address
after the delay slot), likely branches that skip their delay slot when not taken, the Allegrex's encodings for
`clz`, `clo`, `madd`, `maddu`, `msub` and `msubu`, its `min`, `max`, `bitrev`, `wsbw`, `halt`, `mfic` and `mtic`,
unaligned loads and stores (`lwl`, `lwr`, `swl`, `swr`, little-endian), `ll` and `sc`, and the FPU: arithmetic,
compares and their branches, and conversions with the four rounding modes. FPU registers hold bit patterns, so moves
keep NaN payloads. Exceptions go to `exceptionHook` (HLE has no exception vectors), and VFPU instructions raise
ReservedInstruction until part 2.

Not checked against hardware: the result of dividing by zero (it gives what MIPS cores commonly do: `lo` = −1 or 1
by the dividend's sign, `hi` = the dividend), FPU arithmetic in rounding modes other than nearest (the host's
nearest is used), and conversions of NaN or out-of-range values (0x7fffffff, MIPS's default).

Tests: `tests/allegrex/run-tests.sh` (14 groups, with the undefined-behavior sanitizer; on Linux the address
sanitizer too, which the PSP Core Tests workflow runs for changes to `ares/psp/`, nall or ares's types).
`harness.hpp` holds the test machine (a CPU over 64 KiB of RAM) and the instruction encoders.

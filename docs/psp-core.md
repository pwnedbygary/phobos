# PSP core

**Status (2026-10-03):** started, at the user's request. Part 1, the Allegrex CPU's integer and FPU instructions
with host tests, is on branch `cursor/psp-core-2b67`. Nothing is in the app yet.

## Decisions (the user's, 2026-10-03)

- **An original core, written for Phobos.** PPSSPP's code can't come in: it is GPL-2.0-or-later, and the firmware
  ares compiles into the native library can't be under the GPL (see LICENSE and the plan's row "Licenses of bundled
  resources"). A translation or rewording of its code would still be its code.
- **PPSSPP as a reference.** When the documentation runs out, or a design question gets stuck, PPSSPP's code and
  its test programs (pspautotests) may be read for how the PSP behaves or how a problem can be approached. The code
  here is written independently; nothing is copied, translated or reworded from PPSSPP or JPCSP.
- **Retail executables are decrypted with the published keys**, as PPSSPP does. The user accepted the risk: in the
  US the DMCA's anti-circumvention rule covers breaking encryption separately from copyright, and Nintendo's suit
  against Yuzu relied partly on it; Sony hasn't acted against PPSSPP in over a decade. The keys are facts; the
  scheme (the KIRK engine, the `~PSP` header) is written from the PSP Developer Wiki's description.
- **High-level emulation (HLE) of the operating system.** The game's code runs on the emulated Allegrex and its
  display lists on the emulated GE, but the PSP's operating system isn't run: the functions games import are
  Phobos's own. No firmware is needed. Booting Sony's kernel (low-level emulation) would need emulating chips that
  are largely undocumented (the Media Engine, the crypto engines, NAND, the system controller, whose firmware isn't
  in a firmware dump), and no PSP emulator has made that work, while HLE reaches nearly the whole library.
- **Firmware as an option, per module family**, as Flycast offers HLE or the real BIOS: the HLE kernel always runs,
  and a setting can load Sony's own library modules from the user's firmware where running them is easier than
  reimplementing them (the system fonts in `flash0:/font`, the audio codec libraries, perhaps video playback).
  The decryption keys can't come from there: they are in the PSP's crypto hardware, not in the firmware files.

## Sources

- **MIPS32 Architecture for Programmers, Volume II** (MIPS Technologies): the base instruction set. The Allegrex is
  a MIPS II core with a single-precision FPU and some MIPS32r2 instructions.
- **pspdev's PSP VFPU documentation** (<https://pspdev.github.io/vfpu-docs/>): the Allegrex's own instructions, and
  the VFPU, with tests behind its statements.
- **binutils' Allegrex support** (David Guillen Fandos, 2023, `gas/testsuite/gas/mips/allegrex.d`): encodings, and
  assembled examples that the CPU tests use as vectors.
- **Yet Another PlayStation Portable Documentation** (yapspd, hitmen): memory map, coprocessor registers, `halt`,
  `mfic` and `mtic`.
- **PSP Developer Wiki** (<https://www.psdevwiki.com/psp/>): the Allegrex, hardware registers, the PRX format and
  KIRK.
- **PSPSDK** (BSD-licensed headers): the operating system's functions, structures and NIDs.
- **PPSSPP and pspautotests**, for behavior the above don't cover; each use is recorded where the code depends on
  it.

## Design

- Under `ares/psp/` (namespace `ares::PlayStationPortable`), as ares's systems are: around the CPU and the other
  parts goes an ares system, which the runner presents the way it presents the others (picture, sound, controls,
  states). The CPU is plain C++20 so far, so it's tested on the host without the rest of ares (`tests/allegrex/`).
- The CPU works through a `Bus` interface; the memory map (scratchpad, VRAM, main RAM, hardware registers) is a
  `Bus`.
- Imports: the loader writes each imported function's stub as `jr ra` with `syscall n` in its delay slot, `n`
  standing for the function's NID. The CPU passes the code to `syscallHook`; by then `pc` already holds the return
  address, so the HLE kernel can return a value in `v0` or switch threads by saving and restoring the CPU's state.
- Graphics: the GE runs the game's display lists into the emulated VRAM with a software renderer first; the GPU
  later.

## Phases

1. The Allegrex's integer and FPU instructions, host tests (part 1).
2. The VFPU: registers, prefixes, instructions, tested against the pspdev documentation's examples.
3. Memory map; loading an unencrypted `EBOOT.PBP`, ELF or PRX; the first HLE functions (module start, threads,
   display, controls, files); a homebrew test program run on the host.
4. The GE: display lists, a software rasterizer (2D first), the display.
5. In Phobos: the system's entry, ISO and CSO images, a PSP touch layout, saves in a memory stick folder, states.
6. Retail executables: `~PSP` decryption.
7. Audio (`sceAudio`, then ATRAC3+ and MP3), video (PSMF), the optional firmware modules, a recompiler for speed.

## Part 1: the Allegrex CPU

`ares/psp/cpu/allegrex.hpp` and `allegrex.cpp`: an interpreter with branch delay slots (a taken branch sets the address
after the delay slot), likely branches that skip their delay slot when not taken, the Allegrex's encodings for
`clz`, `clo`, `madd`, `maddu`, `msub` and `msubu`, its `min`, `max`, `bitrev`, `wsbw`, `halt`, `mfic` and `mtic`,
unaligned loads and stores (`lwl`, `lwr`, `swl`, `swr`, little-endian), `ll` and `sc`, and the FPU: arithmetic,
compares and their branches, and conversions with the four rounding modes. FPU registers hold bit patterns, so moves
keep NaN payloads. Exceptions go to `exceptionHook` (HLE has no exception vectors), and VFPU instructions raise
ReservedInstruction until part 2.

Not checked against hardware: the result of dividing by zero (it gives what MIPS cores commonly do: `lo` = −1 or 1
by the dividend's sign, `hi` = the dividend), FPU arithmetic in rounding modes other than nearest (the host's
nearest is used), and conversions of NaN or out-of-range values (0x7fffffff, MIPS's default).

Tests: `tests/allegrex/run-tests.sh` (14 groups, with the undefined-behavior sanitizer; on Linux the address
sanitizer too, which the PSP Core Tests workflow runs for changes to `ares/psp/`).
